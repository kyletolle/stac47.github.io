Finally, I made it. I needed a full day of cold rain on French Riviera to create a small site and blog. As I am not a wonderful web designer, I used bootstrap framwork to motivate me. The result is clean and simple: exactly what I wanted to achieve in one afternoon.

Now, the blog section will probably be used to publish the tips and tricks I discover in my journey in the world of computers. Maybe, if I have good ideas will I publish better texts. We'll see...
